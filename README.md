# 🐻 Animated Login with Flutter + Rive

Project developed by **Zair Balam**, exploring the use of interactive animations in Flutter using **Rive**.  

It’s a simple, functional, and animated login interface. Perfect as a base for larger projects or as an eye-catching demo.

## 💡 What’s it about?  

This application shows a **login screen** where an **animated polar bear** reacts in real-time to user interactions:  

- Watches you while typing your email 👀  
- Covers its eyes when typing the password 🙈  
- Reacts happily or sadly depending on the login result 🎉😢  

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies  

- `Flutter` & `Dart` for app development  
- `Rive` for character animation and **State Machines** ⚡  
- `Visual Studio Code` as the development environment  
- `Android Studio` to set up the emulator

## 📁 Project Structure  

```
/lib
 ├── main.dart              # App entry point
 └── screens/
     └── login_screen.dart  # Login screen with animation logic
/assets
 └── animated_login_character.riv  # Rive animation file
```

**Brief explanation:**  
- `main.dart` → Starts the Flutter app and routes to login screen  
- `login_screen.dart` → Handles UI, user input, and controls the Rive State Machine  
- `.riv` file → Contains the polar bear animation and state machine logic

## 🎬 What is Rive & State Machine?  

- **Rive** is a tool to create interactive vector animations that can be integrated into apps and websites. ✨  
- **State Machines** in Rive allow you to control animations dynamically, based on user input or app events 🕹️
